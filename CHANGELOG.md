# What's new

User-visible changes, newest first. Internal hardening (refactors,
test additions, dependency bumps) is not listed here — see the git
log for the full history.

### Quality of life

- **Targeted Official Matches.** When creating an official race,
  organizers can now mark it as **Private** — only the organizer
  and explicitly invited users see it on the index or can register.
  Manage invitees on the race detail page after creating it.
  Default stays Public.
- **In-app inbox.** A bell icon in the navbar shows when you have
  notifications waiting. Draft invites surface here automatically
  (no more discovering them only by visiting the Draft page).
  Clicking the bell marks them read; accept / decline / cancel
  cleans them up.
- **Profile clubs link to uma.moe.** The Club tile on a public
  profile now opens the club's uma.moe page in a new tab.
- **Track-ban panel layout fixed.** Distance and Direction bans
  no longer wrap onto two lines and truncate the uma-ban row
  beside them.
- **Lobby polling no longer wipes ban selections.** Mid-edit
  selections during the track-ban and uma-ban phases survive the
  5-second auto-refresh — the second player to ban won't lose
  their choice while the page polls for the opponent.
- **OCR screenshots stay visible after the match.** Source
  screenshots that were OCR-parsed for a draft match are now
  shown on the completed-match card. Both participants and senior
  organizers can view them; previously only the uploader could.

### Game-rule accuracy

- **Weather × Ground combinations match in-game rules.** Only the
  eight valid combos are accepted (Sunny/Cloudy with Firm/Good,
  Rainy with Soft/Heavy, Snowy with Good/Soft and Winter only).
  The random roll for draft matches respects these too.

### Fairness

- **Uma ban is now truly blind.** Until both players submit, neither
  can see the opponent's pick — not in the side panel, not as a
  grayed tile in the picker. Reveal happens automatically once both
  bans land.

### Permissions and safety

- **Ownership gate on official-race actions.** Organizers can only
  open / close / set-room-code / submit-results / cancel races they
  themselves created. Senior organizers and admins keep moderation
  override.
- **Security cleanup.** Login `next` and post-action redirects now
  reject external URLs (closes a phishing vector). Request body
  size is capped at the WSGI layer. Production cookies are marked
  Secure / HttpOnly / SameSite=Lax.
- **Login lockout against brute force.** After 10 wrong-password
  attempts in a row, the account is locked for 15 minutes — the
  form tells you how long to wait. A correct password at any point
  resets the counter.
- **Admin-issued password resets.** If you forget your password,
  reach out to an admin via Discord — they can generate a one-time
  reset link for you to set a new password. Self-service email
  reset will follow once Discord / Google sign-in is added.
